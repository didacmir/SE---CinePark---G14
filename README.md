ðŸŽ¬ Cinema Web Project Report

Our project consists of a cinema web application designed to offer users a personalized and engaging movie discovery experience. The website includes all the essential features of a modern web platform, such as user sign-up, login, user profiles, and personalized content, all while maintaining a structure closely inspired by our original Figma design. This design includes a homepage, login and sign-up screens, a questionnaire, profile view, and options to log out or retake the questionnaire.

The sign-up and login system is fully functional and stores user information in a .csv file, which serves as a lightweight and easily manageable database. Once a user logs in or signs up, they are guided through a movie preference questionnaire. This system helps us tailor movie recommendations based on the user's choices. Users can access their profile at any time to view their details or retake the questionnaire if their preferences change.

An important aspect of our project is the recommendation system. Based on the data collected through the questionnaire, the system provides suggestions that match the userâ€™s interests. This adds a layer of personalization that makes the experience more enjoyable and relevant.

To keep the movie data up to date, we also implemented a web scraping module. This tool collects information from external movie-related websites, allowing the platform to display the latest and most popular films. As a result, users always have access to current movie content, enhancing the utility and realism of our application.

Throughout the development process, we used Firebase as an AI assistant to support the implementation of various functionalities. Firebase helped us prototype features quickly and manage the integration between front-end and back-end systems. Although we used Firebase mainly as an assistant, we developed and implemented the most important components ourselves, such as the database system, the recommendation engine, and the web scraper. These key modules are also available in our GitHub repository.

Technologically, the platform was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. Data storage is handled using CSV files, and additional logic is implemented in custom scripts. The websiteâ€™s structure mirrors our Figma design, ensuring that the final product matches our initial concept visually and functionally.

In conclusion, this cinema web project showcases a combination of creativity, AI-assisted development, and practical coding skills. It delivers a smooth user experience while offering smart features like content recommendations and live movie updates. We believe this project not only fulfills the technical requirements but also provides a user-centric design that could be expanded and improved in future iterations.
